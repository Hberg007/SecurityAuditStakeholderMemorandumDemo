TO: <h2>Botium Toys IT Manager & Stakeholders</h2>
FROM: <h2>Jim Huderberg</h2>
DATE: <h2>9/6/2023</h2>

SUBJECT: <h2>Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations for Botium Toys</h2>
<br />
<br />
Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<br />
Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.

<h2>Audit Scope:</h2>
● Assess current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
<br />
<br />
●	Assess current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
<br />
<br />
●	Assess current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
<br />
<br />
●	Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
<br />
<br />
●	Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Audit Goals:</h2>
●	To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)
<br />
<br />
●	Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant
<br />
<br />
●	Fortify system controls
<br />
<br />
●	Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management
<br />
<br />
●	Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks
<br />
<br />
●	Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

<br />
<br />
<h2>Critical Findings (must be addressed immediately):</h2> 
1.	No solid policies in place to limit access to sensitive data.
<br />
<br />
2.	No data backup plans or disaster recovery policies in place to ensure business continuity in case of an attack.
<br />
<br />
3.	No password protection policies in place
<br />
<br />
4.	No Antivirus Software, Data Encryption, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), or manual monitoring/maintenance programs in place.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need):</h2>
5.	No physical security systems in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or assets.
<br />
<br />

<h2>Summary/Recommendations:</h2>
<br />
<br />
1.	Ensure vendors and non-authorized staff only have access to the assets/data they need to perform their jobs to limit the amount of data they have access to. 
We also suggest limiting employees account access to ensure no one employee has too much access to sensitive data to limit the amount of damage they can perform 
if they turn out to be a threat actor.
<br />
<br />
2.	Implement a disaster recovery plan which includes scheduled data backups to ensure the business operations continue uninterrupted in the event of a data 
breach or an attack occurs.
<br />
<br />
3.	Establish strong password rules for users to improve overall security.
<br />
<br />
4.	Implement data encryption, install Antivirus Software, and Intrusion Detection Systems to monitor data for breaches.
<br />
<br />
5.	Installing locks for rooms housing sensitive data as well as installing locking cabinets for network gear and time-controlled safes will limit the 
exposure to unauthorized personnel. Also installing closed -circuit TV surveillance and adding adequate lighting will add to the overall security of data.
<br />
<br />
<h2> Summary:
<br />
<br />
Following the above-mentioned corrections will not only better secure Botium Toys  assets and sensitive data, but will also bring them up to 
compliance with the E.U.’s regulations outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and meet the international requirements of 
the Payment Card Industry Data Standard (PCI DSS). 
<br />
<br />
These corrections along with monitoring reports generated from the System and Organizations 
Controls (SOC type 1 & 2) will add an extra layer of fraud protection to this business.
